Experience      Website Designer  ,   12/2016   to   Current    Company Name   －   City  ,   State      Currently working as a freelancer to redesign websites for my own clients and customers.  The process involved working with the client during all stages of development:.  Discussed requirements, documentation, and business needs regarding the design of the site.  Created mockups to get client approval before starting the coding.  Worked with the client throughout the testing stages to make sure they were happy.  Delivered the final website within the client's budget and the quoted timeframe.  Used: C#, ASP.Net, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, mySQL, Adobe Design Suite.

This involved taking a client's XSLT and XML files and transforming them with custom mapping software into LUXML files, which were then processed by the Velocity software.  Our team reduced the number of hours it took to migrate a client by 62.5%, from 800 hours, down to 500 hours.  Worked with the lead developer to create testing and review processes to ensure the version 3 mapping files contained the same data and calculations as the version 2 mapping files.  Helped develop unit testing software to ensure the LUXML files were fully tested before delivering them to the client.  Supervised and reviewed the work of 3 offshore developers in India.  Used: XML, XSLT, Visual Basic, SQL Server, TFS, JIRA.

Used C#, Visual Studio 2014, SQL Server 2012, TFS, Agile development, and .NET Framework 4.5.          Lead Software Developer  ,   12/2014   to   02/2016    Company Name   －   City  ,   State      A company which creates digital models for clients for use in artwork, animation, and other projects, as well as designs and develops websites.  Supervised and led a team of developers on a number of projects.  This included guiding and mentoring the junior developers and helping them improve their skills.  Worked as a project manager on a project which involved creating a model of a soccer player for a client.  This included going back and forth between the client and the model-maker to refine the model as needed.  Created, redesigned, and cleaned up websites for a number of clients, using C#, ASP.Net, AngularJS, and PHP.  Created digital models of a hospital interior for a medical equipment company.  This involved having phone meetings with the client to create a list of requirements which were passed to the model-maker.          Software Developer  ,   08/2014   to   12/2014    Company Name   －   City  ,   State      Assigned to Bank of America's CaseCura application, which gathers evidence and documents from for use in legal cases.  Created new user interface (UI) designs by replacing obsolete pages with data-bound dynamic grid web controls.  This improved the user experience, which led to happier users.  Led design and documentation sessions to get user feedback at every step in the design process.  This helped our team determine the best course of action for new feature requests and let the users be more involved in the decision-making process.  Led user-acceptance review meetings after the code changes were complete.  This ensured that the code met the user's specifications before the code was put into production.  Participated in daily scrum meetings to make sure all software development was on schedule.  Used: C#, MVC, TFS, .NET Framework 4.5, JIRA for ticket tracking, SQL Server, Agile development methodologies.

Assigned to the AgAdvantage Legacy application, which processed crop insurance policies.  Also investigated and determined the best course of action for maintenance tickets received from the business analysts.  Worked closely with the business analysts and QA team to ensure all code followed the company's standards.  Was instrumental in reducing the number of maintenance tickets in the queue: when I started in October, there were around 50 tickets; by February, we managed to reduce the number to about 3 or 4 a day.  Participated in the weekly ""Lunch & Learn"" meetings where all the developers would discuss a current issue and brainstorm about how to solve it.  Used VB.Net, Visual Studio 2012, MVC, SQL Server, Atlassian JIRA (source code repository), .NET Framework 4.5.

Created web-based reports for the CFO which analyzed the credit scores and debt-to-income ratio for loan applications so he could determine the financial risk of the loans.  Maintained and upgraded the existing web-based reports based on feedback from the loan openers, loan officers, and loan processors.  Helped to create and develop the Customer Mortgage Application, which let customers apply for a mortgage online.

Monitored the daily reports to make sure they accurately reflected the payments processed by the system.  Upgraded the reports as needed, based on user feedback and requests.  Used VB 6, Windows NT, SQL Server 7, and Crystal Reports 8.5.  Re-designed and re-architected the RRS trouble-ticket database system to upgrade it from a Microsoft Access file to a completely new ASP/ web based application with a SQL Server database backend.  I was also assigned the task of adding additional features, such as an all-new interface (including new graphics and all-new layout), new security (users would now have to login), user auditing (tracking who updated what information), additional reports, additional fields (to accommodate Sarbanes-Oxley code-change regulations) and to consolidate numerous systems into one database.  Used ASP, HTML, and SQL Server 2000.  Hosted an hour-long panel discussion on the history and development of video games and digital artwork at MegaCon 2015 (April 2015).  Around 250 people attended, with people standing against the side and rear walls.  I've been using the Adobe Suite of tools since 1999.
